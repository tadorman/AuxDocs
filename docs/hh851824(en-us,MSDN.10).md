Windows Azure handles allocating, tuning, and managing hardware resources required for a website so you can focus on developing the website you want with tools of your choice. Windows Azure will even build and deploy a website of your choice from one of several website templates provided by the Azure website gallery. After you have created a website in Windows Azure you can manage website performance and the website’s access to other Windows Azure resources.

##Managing how the web site performs

Windows Azure allows you to quickly increase a website’s performance and fault tolerance by configuring the website to run in dedicated (**reserved**) mode and/or by configuring the website with multiple runtime instances. You can evaluate a summary of your website’s performance from the **Dashboard** tab or configure and view detailed website performance metrics from the **Monitor** tab.

##Managing how the web site utilizes other Windows Azure resources

If your website requires access to a relational database you can create a SQL database instance and link it to your website. If you create a template based website that requires access to a MySQL database, the database will be created and linked to the website when the website is being created.
